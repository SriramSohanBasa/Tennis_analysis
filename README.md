# Tennis Analysis System

This project leverages machine learning, computer vision, and deep learning techniques to create a comprehensive tennis analysis system. Utilizing YOLO, a state-of-the-art object detector, the system detects players and tennis balls in real-time. The project also incorporates object tracking to follow detected objects across frames and employs a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect key points on the tennis court.

## Libraries Used

1. **Ultralytics YOLOv8**: A state-of-the-art object detector used for detecting players and tennis balls in images and videos.
2. **OpenCV (CV2)**: Used for reading, manipulating, and saving video files, as well as performing various image processing tasks.
3. **PyTorch**: Employed for building and training the custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for key point detection on the tennis court.
4. **NumPy**: Utilized for numerical operations and array manipulations, providing support for handling large datasets.
5. **Matplotlib**: Used for visualizing detection results, tracking data, and key point detections in a graphical format.
6. **Scipy**: Provides additional functionality for optimization, integration, and other advanced computations.
